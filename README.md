# Koinx_project
This project is a backend service that provides real-time cryptocurrency data and analytics. The API is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database hosting). It allows users to retrieve information about various cryptocurrencies and perform analytics on them, including price data, market cap, 24-hour change, and standard deviation of prices over time.

Features
Fetch Latest Cryptocurrency Data: The API fetches real-time cryptocurrency data from an external API and stores it in a MongoDB database. Supported cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon.

/stats Endpoint: Allows users to get the latest statistics (price, market cap, and 24-hour change) of a specific cryptocurrency. Query the API using the coin query parameter (e.g., bitcoin, ethereum, or matic-network).

/deviation Endpoint: Returns the standard deviation of the price for a specific cryptocurrency over the last 100 records stored in the database. This helps users understand price volatility over time.

Technologies Used
. Node.js and Express.js: For building the backend REST API.
. MongoDB Atlas: Cloud-based NoSQL database service to store and 
  retrieve cryptocurrency data.
. Axios: For fetching real-time data from the CoinGecko API.
. PM2: For managing and ensuring the server runs continuously in 
  production environments.
. Cron Jobs: Scheduled tasks to periodically fetch and update 
  cryptocurrency data.
. Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB.
